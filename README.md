PENAWAR SELF-SERVICE MEDICINE MACHINE

CSC126 â€“ FUNDAMENTALS OF ALGORITHM AND COMPUTER PROBLEM SOLVING

The Penawar Self-Service Medicine Machine was inspired by the standard vending machines that are typically used for food and drinks. The concept was developed to solve the problem of the Penawar Clinic being closed during weekends and outside of normal working hours. As a result, my team and I came up with an idea to develop a system that allows students to purchase medicine 24 hours a day, even when the clinic is not open. (develop using Dev C++)
